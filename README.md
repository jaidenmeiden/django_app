[Integrating TailwindCSS into Flask Apps](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/integrate-tailwindcss-into-flask/)

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework used to build frontend applications. TailwindCSS differs from other kinds of CSS frameworks as it gives the user total control over their design.

Rather than adding obscure CSS classes to your code, with TailwindCSS you use utility classes to create your components, with as much control over every single styling as you want. All without having to ever write a single line of CSS.
