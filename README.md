### Creating a project

If this is your first time using Django, you’ll have to take care of some initial setup. Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a **Django project – a collection** of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.

From the command line, **cd** into a directory where you’d like to store your code, then run the following command:

```
# New project
django-admin startproject photobucket

# New project with existing files
django-admin startproject photobucket .

```

### Launch application
```

```

### Testing
```

```

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework used to build frontend applications. TailwindCSS differs from other kinds of CSS frameworks as it gives the user total control over their design.

Rather than adding obscure CSS classes to your code, with TailwindCSS you use utility classes to create your components, with as much control over every single styling as you want. All without having to ever write a single line of CSS.
